#Three Observable Trends in the Heroes of Pymoli

#Observation the First (Gender):
-At 84% of the total players, males represent the highest percentage of participants in the game and the largest target audience for any gender-specific marketing. However, males do not represent the highest per person purchases; rather, they represent the lowest. The users who spend the most on average ($4.56) identify as neither male nor female and represent 1.9% of all users. Females come in second for average purchases per person at $4.47 and representing only 14.1% of all game players.

-Though female players and players of undisclosed genders represent a very small percentage of total unique players, they are more likely to spend more on individual purchases.

#Observation the Second (Age):
-20-24 year olds represent the both the greatest number of players in a given age group (258 out of 576 unique players, or nearly 45%) and the largest portion of spending with a Total Purchase Value of $1,114.06. The next nearest spending group is 15-19 year olds at $412.89 and 25-29 year olds at $293.

-However, it is 35-39 year old who are spending the most on each individual purchase, with an Average Pruchase Price of $3.60 and the highest Average Total Purchase per Person at $4.76. This indicates that while younger players (15-24 year olds) represent the lion's share of revenue due to sheer volume, other age demographics are willing to spend more on individual purchases.

#Observation the Third (Spending):
-The highest spenders in Heroes of Pymoli were Lisosia93, Idastidru52, Chamjask73, Iral74, and Iskadarya95. Each had 5, 4, 3, 4, and 3 separate pruchases through the app respectively, to Total Purchase Values ranging from $13.10 to $18.96. The Average Purchase Prices for these top spenders ranged from $3.41 to $4.61. These relatively low averages indicate that repeat purchases can mean strong revenue growth for Heroes of Pymoli.

-The most popular Item of all 179 unique items was purchased 13 times for a Total Purchase Value of $59.99.
